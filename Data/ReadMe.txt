To select the samples, first old extracted DNAs were tested using Nanodrop and put on a gel. DNA doesn't seem to be degraded, but impure and at low concentrations.

Therefore, DNA was newly extracted from tissue that was stored in ethanol. Note that only small ammounts were left for some individuals (mostly BU is problematic).

Only females were selected to get data for both sex chromosomes (females are heterogametic sex).

32 samples were selected:
-each two individuals for six/four introduced populations
	IT: BB, VT, NF, SH, WS, DL
	FR: BU, CW, WB, WE
-each one individual for six locations in the native ranges of IT and FR:
	IT: GC,CA,CE,FU,MM,VG
	FR: DN,VR,MI,PZ,LI,FC
